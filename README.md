# TLC Data Analysis
This is my analysis of 2013 NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission data on yellow cabs.

Data courtesy of the FOIL odyessey of [Chris Whong](https://chriswhong.com/open-data/foil_nyc_taxi/) and its storage in a BigQuery depository by [Jason H](https://plus.google.com/+JasonHall-ImJasonH) - thank you.

You can view the HTML output of my analysis **[right here](https://alexnpowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/tlc.html)**. Its underlying code is fully documented in this repo, and mostly documented in that HTML knit of the R Markdown document I wrote the analysis in.
